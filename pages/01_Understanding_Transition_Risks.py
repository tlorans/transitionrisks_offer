### Transition Risks Definition
         
Here, we define transition risks as changes in investor expectations around transition scenarios. Namely, 
we consider risks as changes from the continuation of the current state (Current Policies scenarios) 
to a future state, where the future state is defined by the NGFS climate transition scenarios.
""")

st.write("""
### Method 
         
We employ a free-cash flows model and only consider change in value due to the cash flows channel (i.e., no change in discount rates).
The future expected cash flows are calculated under the NGFS climate scenarios, and the difference between the current and future discounted expected cash flows is the repricing effect.
         
We decompose the repricing effect into two components:
1. Loss due to net carbon tax
2. Loss due to revenue
""")

st.write("""
### Main Result
         
The revenue is the most significant component of the total loss in most of sectors.

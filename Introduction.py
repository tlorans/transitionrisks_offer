    """
    Amenc et al. (2014) highlight the two main challenges involved in a sound approach to equity investing according to asset pricing theory: 
    (i) efficiently capturing rewarded factors, and (ii) diversifying away—i.e., reducing exposure to—unrewarded risks. As climate finance 
    is a burgeoning field, the question of how to articulate climate-related risks into this well-recognized investing problem is an open one. 
    To do so, one should first determine in which box climate-related risks may belong: rewarded or unrewarded risks.

    Climate finance literature has investigated whether climate-related risks constitute a new source of rewarded risks. 
    The debate is still ongoing, as no consensus on the topic has been reached yet, as shown in the table below.

Pastor et al. (2021, 2022) and Ardia et al. (2023)
provide a source of interpretation for these inconclusive results: 
         realized returns of transition risks 
         factor portfolios may strongly 
         differ from expected returns 
         due to unexpected change 
         in climate concerns. 
         In an event of unexpected 
         increase (decrease) 
         in climate concerns, 
         green (brown) stocks 
         may outperform, 
         resulting in positive (negative) 
         realized returns for a
        green-minus-brown factor for example. 
         
In that context, Pastor et al. (2022) have shown 
that a green factor portfolio outperforms in period 
of unexpected increase in climate concerns.
In this course, we are going to explore the transitory 
outperformance of the green factor.
